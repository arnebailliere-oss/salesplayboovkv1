  ],
  "content": "<p>Enterprise proposals follow a <strong>logical and audit-ready structure</strong>. Each section\u2014from Executive Summary to Technical Annex\u2014serves a defined purpose. Decision-makers often read only the first two pages, so the summary must <strong>teach value through clarity</strong>. Avoid emotional or marketing language. Replace adjectives with facts, outcomes, and validation points.</p><p>Use the playbook\u2019s template as your baseline. Every proposal must contain: cover letter, context, objectives, Scifeon overview, solution design, implementation plan, governance model, risk and mitigation, commercial terms, and annexes. The tone must remain factual and aligned with Scifeon\u2019s brand of precision and calm authority.</p>",
