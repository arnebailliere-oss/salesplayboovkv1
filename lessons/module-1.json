Each persona\u2014QA Manager, IT Lead, Lab Director, Procurement Officer\u2014views Scifeon from a different angle. Successful sales communication aligns with their concerns: <em>QA wants validation traceability</em>, <em>IT needs data integrity and integration</em>, <em>Procurement demands predictable cost of ownership</em>.</p><p>Scifeon sales engagements must therefore map and document the buyer structure early. The buyer\u2019s internal project maturity determines both <strong>sales speed</strong> and <strong>negotiation position</strong>. Always prepare a stakeholder matrix with their roles, interests, and risks addressed explicitly in your presentation or proposal.</p>",
