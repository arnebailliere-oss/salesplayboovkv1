Governance structures\u2014steering committees, escalation paths, documented responsibilities\u2014signal maturity and control. Include them proactively, not reactively.</p><p>When presenting validation, reference recognized frameworks such as <em>GAMP 5</em> or <em>21 CFR Part 11</em>. Show exactly how Scifeon\u2019s process produces traceable, auditable results. This reassures QA and Procurement that adopting Scifeon will not expose them to compliance uncertainty.</p>",
