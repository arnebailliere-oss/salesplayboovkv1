  "content": "<p>Process discipline transforms Scifeon\u2019s work from ad hoc to auditable. Every proposal must follow <strong>defined QA checkpoints</strong>: internal review, cross-check, and version approval. Each stage must be documented in the version history section of the proposal template.</p><p>Enterprise clients expect <strong>traceability of authorship and approval</strong>. Missing version control or inconsistent formatting signals immaturity. Our goal is to show that Scifeon operates under the same standards we enable for our customers\u2014organized, validated, and documented.</p>",
