  "content": "<p>The <strong>Challenger Sales Method</strong> is Scifeon\u2019s foundation for enterprise conversations. It consists of three pillars: <strong>Teach</strong> \u2013 deliver an unexpected but relevant insight; <strong>Tailor</strong> \u2013 adapt your message to each stakeholder; <strong>Take Control</strong> \u2013 lead the process confidently without aggression.</p><p>In practice, this means identifying patterns in how labs lose efficiency or compliance control and teaching those patterns back to the customer with evidence. The goal is not persuasion but <strong>professional education</strong>\u2014helping the buyer see their process differently. Taking control means defining next steps clearly and respectfully.</p>",
